// CASE: ONLY CAN REACH INGREDIENTS ////
// For this situation, the agent can only reach ingredients and ingredients only. They cannot reach the other objects as 
// counters are blocking their way of getting there. In this situation the agent will:
//      1) Check for the current recipe how many ingredients it needs.
//      2) Pass each of them indiviually to the humans on counters shared by both the human and the agent. If there is no
//         free counters because the human is stalling, the agent will wait until one frees. The agent passes an ingredient
//         to its closest counter as it is more intuitive for the human to go where the agent is. Otherwise, as long as the 
//         human is moving, the agent will move too and not place down the ingredient.
//      3) This plan continues until all of the recipes from the Orders list have been served.
//      4) A current recipe in the order list is checked as folows:
//              -the plan calls an internal action that initially checks the first recipe (index N=1).

//               the recipes to follow.
//              -Had the human made a mistake on any of the orders, the agent will pass those ingredients again after passing ingredients for the 
//               other recipes first. For more info on this please check get_recipe_at_index.java
